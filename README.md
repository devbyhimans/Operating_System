# **Operating System Concepts: Implementations and Examples**

Welcome to the Operating Systems repository\! This project is a collection of C programs that explore and implement fundamental concepts of operating systems, focusing on system calls, Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms, threads, signals, and classic synchronization problems.

## **🌟 About The Project**

This repository serves as a practical guide and hands-on implementation hub for key OS concepts. The goal is to provide clear, well-commented code that demonstrates how these low-level functionalities work. Whether you're a student learning about operating systems or a developer looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find valuable examples here.

## **🚀 Core Concepts Covered**

This repository contains implementations for the following topics:

### **📞 Basic System Calls**

A collection of programs demonstrating the use of fundamental system calls for process management found in the basics directory.

* fork(): Creating child processes.  
* wait(): Synchronizing parent and child processes.  
* sleep(): Suspending process execution.  
* getpid() & getppid(): Retrieving process and parent process IDs.

## ⚡ Threads & Signals

- **Threads**: Implementations exploring multi-threading concepts.  
- **Signals**: Programs demonstrating how to handle signals for asynchronous event handling. This includes:  
  - Setting up custom signal handlers using `signal()` and `sigaction()`.  
  - Sending signals to processes using the `kill()` system call.  
  - Using signals for inter-process communication, such as in the `sharedmemory_signal` example.  


### **🔄 Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**

Implementations of various IPC mechanisms to allow processes to communicate and synchronize their actions.

* **Anonymous Pipes:** Unidirectional communication between related processes.  
* **Named Pipes (FIFO):** Communication between unrelated processes (TwoWayCommfifo).  
* **Shared Memory:** Allowing multiple processes to access the same memory segment.  
* **Polling:** Efficiently handling I/O from multiple sources.

### **🔒 Synchronization Problems**

Solutions to classic concurrency and synchronization problems, demonstrating how to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.

* **Producer-Consumer Problem**  
* **Reader-Writer Problem**  
* **Dining Philosophers Problem**

### **💻 Applications**

Practical applications built using the concepts above to showcase their real-world utility.

* **One-to-One Chat System**  
* **Shared Chat System (Group Chat)**

## **🛠️ Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get the code up and running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

You will need a Cpp compiler (like g++) and a Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS) to run these examples.

### **Compilation and Execution**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git\](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)  
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Navigate to a specific implementation's directory:**  
   cd pipes/

3. **Compile the C file using gcc:**  
   * For basic programs:  
     g++ source\_file.cpp \-o output\_file 

   * When using threads (pthreads), you must link the pthread library:  
     g++ \-lpthread source\_file.cpp \-o output\_file 

   * When using the math library, link it with \-lm:  
     g++ \-o output\_file source\_file.c \-lm

4. **Run the compiled executable:**  
   ./output\_file

   *Note: Some programs, especially the chat applications, may require running multiple executables (e.g., a server and a client) in separate terminal windows.*
