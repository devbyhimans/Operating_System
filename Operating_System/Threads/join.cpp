// What happens here?

// We create 4 threads one by one
// After creating each thread, the main thread immediately waits (pthread_join) for that thread to finish.
// So, the main thread will not proceed to create the next thread until the current one finishes.
// The child thread sleeps for 1 second, prints a message, and then ends.
// The main thread prints its own message, waits for the child thread, and repeats.

// Result:
// Threads run sequentially â€” main waits for each child thread to complete before moving on.

// Why use join?
// To ensure the main thread waits for child threads to finish before proceeding or terminating.
